# CE-Junior-Lab-Project-5
Digital Etch-A-Sketch style drawing system.  Two potentiometers are used to draw on a 255 x 255 pixel canvas.  A USB keyboard connected to the FPGA can change the cursor width, canvas size, and ink color.  The representation of the drawing surface is displayed on a VGA monitor connected to the FPGA and on a PC's screen through software that communicates via UART with the FPGA.
Hardware written using Vivado in VHDL.
